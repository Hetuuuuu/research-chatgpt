# research-chatgpt
Conducted an in-depth research project in Winter 2023 focusing on ChatGPT, an AI-powered chatbot developed by OpenAI. The primary objective was to gauge academic opinions on ChatGPT's utilization in education, specifically exploring whether universities should permit its use and under what conditions.

Project Tasks:

I. Survey Design:
- Developed a comprehensive survey comprising at least five dependent variable questions addressing ChatGPT-related topics and five independent variable questions gathering demographic information.
- Formulated sample questions, including queries about personal experiences with ChatGPT, perceptions of its potential for plagiarism, its impact on education, anticipated uses by students, and demographic details such as age.

II. Survey Implementation:
- Deployed the survey online, with an option for hardcopy responses (to be manually entered for data consistency).
- Ensured a sufficiently large sample size for robust study outcomes.

III. Data Analysis with Python:
- Collected and compiled survey data.
- Employed Python programming language for data analysis, generating relevant figures, charts, and tables.

IV. Report Writing:
- Authored a detailed report (800-1000 words) with the following sections:
  - Introduction to ChatGPT: Brief overview of ChatGPT and its history.
  - Relevant Figures/Charts/Tables: Presented data visually with appropriate captions.
  - Findings from the Data: Summarized key survey results, emphasizing academic perceptions of ChatGPT.
  - Benefits and Limitations: Discussed both the advantages and drawbacks of ChatGPT in an educational context.
  - Future of ChatGPT: Analyzed the potential future role of ChatGPT in shaping education.
  - Conclusion: Summarized key points and provided personal insights on ChatGPT.

V. PowerPoint Presentation:
- Developed a concise PowerPoint presentation (maximum 15 slides) summarizing key aspects of the research project.
